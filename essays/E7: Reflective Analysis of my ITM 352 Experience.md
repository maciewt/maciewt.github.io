## 1. Course Goals ITM 352 has the following goals:
### 1.1 Acquiring basic programming skills in an IT context
I feel I reached this goal once I learned basic JavaScript because I could combine codes to accomplish the objective of the task for the code. Everything built upon that first understanding of JavaScrip with the introduction of the onmouseover, onmouseout, if-statements, etc.
### 1.2 Understanding why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge
I would say the store WODs indicated that I met this goal because it was the first time that I could see the coding in a business aspect. I know that MIS is the cross between business and programming, and these WODs showed me why. If I had no basic programming skills and knowledge, I would not be able to explain how or why the applications work, and I certainly couldn't troubleshoot if something went wrong with the application.
### 1.3 Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications
The store WODs and Assignments indicate that I have met this goal. Before this class, the most I was able to do was create basic webpages in HTML from my ICS 101 class. When the class first started, I did not understand the javascript or JSON language or how to use it. I then learned enough skills to be able to create the first store in the WODs and continue updating it to a more useable interface with the Assignments. Without the Assignments and store WODs, the lab exercises would not have given me hands-on experience in developing software applications.
### 1.4 Experiencing first-hand MIS problems and solutions
Assignment 2 gave me a lot of issues that I had to learn how to troubleshoot or ask help on. I learned to utilize the console as a resource to log things in so I could have a better understanding of where the issue is. I got to see how ChatGPT and solutions from Prof. Port were very different in terms of complexity. 
### 1.5 Experiencing and understanding first-hand project management, working in teams, software development issues
I didn't accomplish working in teams because I did not do my Assignment 2 with a partner, but it did teach me that asking others for help can be beneficial since it's an outside perspective. First-hand project management and software development issues were again accomplished with Assignments 1 and 2, respectively. 
### 1.6 Gaining confidence in addressing MIS problems
As I said before in goal 1.4, I gained confidence by using the console when I had issues because I could see what was not working and fix the problems accordingly. ChatGPT was a helpful tool in seeing syntactic issues that were causing problems in my code. It was also useful to take my goal in natural language and give me a start at changing it to JavaScript language and how I could implement it.

## 2. Course Elements and Personal Engagement
### 2.1 What did you learn from creating a professional portfolio and using it in ITM 352?
I don't think I learned much from that. It is a nice platform to use to keep all of the projects that a user might have worked on, but there is already LinkedIn and other platforms similar to that. I don't think I would really have a use for a professional portfolio since LinkedIn provides that for me when I enter my information. 
### 2.2 What did you gain from doing the WODs?
The WODs gave me more confidence in my abilities, especially when the screencasts stopped being provided. I started to trust my instincts and think about what would be easiest for me to do. It also taught me that there are different ways to accomplish the same task with code. During lab, we are primarily to follow along with Prof. Port, but in the WODs without the screencasts, we could do it however we wanted to as long as we used skills learned in class and it followed the requirements. 
### 2.3 Were the quizzes helpful in preparing you for the labs?
They were not helpful because the readings were sometimes too long for me to get through and made me more stressed. I was often too busy finishing the lab from the previous lab to do the readings properly. A few times, the quizzes were not the same as what was in the reading, so if syntax was off for the fill-in-the-blank answers, it would get really frustrating.
### 2.4 What did you learn from doing the labs?
I learned how the code, servers, etc. worked and not just what the code was to do it. I got really familiar with the differences between server-side and client-side because of the constant conceptual questions throughout the lab because of it. It also gave us an opportunity to try out code and use it before the large assignments we would encounter. 
### 2.5 What did you learn from doing the essays?
I don't think I learned much from the essays. It gave me the ability to reflect on what strategies I had been using and how I worked on things, but I never reviewed it. The essays often took a long time, so I just did what I could to be honest and get through it as fast as possible. After doing an assignment or Store WOD, I would much rather have been able to relax than having to do an essay on what I had just struggled with.
### 2.6 What did you learn from doing Assignment 1 and Assignment 2?
In Assignment 1, I learned how to use a template and implement my own design. Forms were very important to use in Assignment 1. I got better at changing natural language into code with different rules to check the quantity input with. In Assignment 2, I learned more about the query string and how to keep elements consistent even when moving from one page to the next. I got a better understanding of the differences between GET and POST. I saw how the node modules were imported and used as long as we looked up what it was, like I had the IR 1 where I had to download the cipher module and use ChatGPT to figure out how it was used. 

<br/>
## 3. Challenges and Achievements
### 3.1 Detail the specific challenges you encountered during the course, such as understanding new programming concepts, completing WODs, web application development assignments.
I don't have any specific challenges encountered besides the query string in Assignment 2. I understood the concepts and how to apply them to the objective. The consistent query string across pages in Assignment 2 was the only thing that I had trouble with and needed to consult with Prof. Port. 
### 3.2 Explain how you overcame these challenges and the strategies that helped you succeed.
I overcame the query string by first attempting to use ChatGPT, but it didn't work, so I met with Prof. Port. That's pretty much it.
### 3.3 Highlight any particular achievements or milestones in the course that were significant to you.
The completion of Store 1 WOD was significant to me because I felt like it was the first "big" application of skills that we were meant to do on our own. It took a while to figure out, but I was proud of myself for completing it and it gave me more confidence in what I was doing.

## 4. Skill Development and Application
### 4.1 Reflect on the three skill levels outlined in the course (syntactic, algorithmic, application) and discuss your progression through these levels.
The beginning of the course was syntactic-focused, just getting us used to creating HTML pages, starting and stopping the server, and knowing how GET works. I think I progressed through this part quickly and it wasn't very difficult because I took ICS 101 and many of the HTML skills we had already learned in that course. The algorithmic section was pretty difficult because I had no prior experience using JavaScript, so all of it was new to me. These were like the functions, loops, if-statements, etc. We would learn and then put the different algorithmic code together to make a bigger statement. I would say the application skill level was worked on right before spring break and the rest of the class, starting with the Store WODs. This was both extremely difficult and fairly easy because some things we had prior experience with from labs, so it was just taking code we already knew and applying it in a different way. Other parts were really hard to think of how to write a natural language into the correct code that would work. I think after Assignment 1, I was doing well with the application skill because it gave me more confidence.
### 4.2 Describe how the hands-on experience with web-based e-service applications enhanced your understanding and confidence in handling MIS issues.
This was already talked about in 4.1, 2.6, and 1. It taught me that I knew what I was doing and that ChatGPT is a good resource for small troubleshooting and help. 

## 5. Use of AI (e.g. ChatGPT)
<br/>
### 5.1 Discuss how use of AI enhanced your learning and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI effectively.
AI was an excellent tool for troubleshooting small issues that may have been syntax related. I often used AI when I would get errors in my console but didn't know what they meant. I was able to copy the error into ChatGPT, along with the corresponding code I was trying to run and it would tell me where the error was located or some things I could do to fix it. I also used ChatGPT to create the base for some of my if statements and functions. I could tell it what I wanted to accomplish with my function and the different loops, ifs, or variables that I wanted to use and it would generate a base for me. I then did not have to create the whole thing because I tweaked the base with my own information to do what I needed. 
### 5.2 Discuss how use of AI inhibited your learning or and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI ineffectively.
While AI was good at creating a base for my functions, it would sometimes give me things that I had not learned. Most of the time, I was able to recognize that we hadn't learned it and I told it to generate something new, but sometimes I would be so stuck that I accepted ChatGPT's suggestion and it would lead to bigger issues. This happened to me during Assignment 2 when I couldn't figure out how to move the quantities through the query string so I had asked ChatGPT and it made me use localStorage, which we had not learned. It ended up causing me more trouble when I wanted to move the quantities to the invoice, so I ultimately asked Prof. Port for help and erased all the GPT code for that. It made me stuck for 3 days when it could have been easily fixed had I asked Prof. Port earlier.

## 6. Future Implications and Professional Growth
### 6.1 Explore how the skills and knowledge gained from ITM 352 can be applied in your future academic and professional endeavors.
Learning how to troubleshoot on my own using the web browser console, AI, and other resources will be helpful in my academics considering that not all professors are always available or willing to help with issues. ITM 352 gave me a base understanding of JavaScript and coding that I can build upon to maybe create websites or other applications for businesses. It is also a good skill to be able to put basic JavaScript knowledge on my resume. 
### 6.2 Discuss the potential impacts these skills will have on your career, especially in terms of understanding and addressing MIS problems.
These skills will probably come in handy if I were to be in a career with MIS. If I work on these skills I could design websites or at least be able to troubleshoot them. This was pretty much already talked about in 6.1.
### 6.3 Reflect on the overall value of the course in your educational journey and future career.
I think this course has given me the confidence to continue with the MIS major and perhaps get a master's degree in it. I had been advised that this is one of, if not the hardest course in the MIS pathway, so I feel accomplished to have survived it. I was unsure at first, but I found the content and the web creation to be interesting and enjoyable, so I think it is something I would be happy doing for my career. I learned how to solve problems on my own and utilize my resources to the fullest.
