## 1. Course Goals ITM 352 has the following goals:
<br/> 
### 1.1 Acquiring basic programming skills in an IT context

### 1.2 Understanding why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge
I would say the store WODs indicated that I met this goal because it was the first time that I could see the coding in a business aspect. I know that MIS is the cross between business and programming, and these WODs showed me why. If I had no basic programming skills and knowledge, I would not be able to explain how or why the applications work, and I certainly couldn't troubleshoot if something went wrong with the application.
### 1.3 Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications
The store WODs and Assignments indicate that I have met this goal. Before this class, the most I was able to do was create basic webpages in HTML from my ICS 101 class. When the class first started, I did not understand the javascript or JSON language or how to use it. I then learned enough skills to be able to create the first store in the WODs and continue updating it to a more useable interface with the Assignments. Without the Assignments and store WODs, the lab exercises would not have given me hands-on experience in developing software applications.
### 1.4 Experiencing first-hand MIS problems and solutions
Assignment 2 gave me a lot of issues that I had to learn how to troubleshoot or ask help on. I learned to utilize the console as a resource to log things in so I could have a better understanding of where the issue is. It also 
### 1.5 Experiencing and understanding first-hand project management, working in teams, software development issues
### 1.6 Gaining confidence in addressing MIS problems
### 1.7 For each of the above goals, explain what stands out in your class experience that indicates you have met that goal. You do not need to be comprehensive but do be specific. You should make each goal a sub-section.

## 2. Course Elements and Personal Engagement
<br/>
### 2.1 What did you learn from creating a professional portfolio and using it in ITM 352?
### 2.2 What did you gain from doing the WODs?
### 2.3 Were the quizzes helpful in preparing you for the labs?
They were not helpful because the readings were sometimes too long for me to get through and made me more stressed. I was often too busy finishing the lab from the previous lab to do the readings properly. A few times, the quizzes were not the same as what was in the reading, so if syntax was off for the fill-in-the-blank answers, it would get really frustrating.
### 2.4 What did you learn from doing the labs?
I learned how the code, servers, etc. worked and not just what the code was to do it. I got really familiar with the differences between server-side and client-side because of the constant conceptual questions throughout the lab because of it. It also gave us an opportunity to try out code and use it before the large assignments we would encounter. 
### 2.5 What did you learn from doing the essays?
I don't think I learned much from the essays. It gave me the ability to reflect on what strategies I had been using and how I worked on things, but I never reviewed it. The essays often took a long time, so I just did what I could to be honest and get through it as fast as possible. After doing an assignment or Store WOD, I would much rather have been able to relax than having to do an essay on what I had just struggled with.
### 2.6 What did you learn from doing Assignment 1 and Assignment 2?

<br/>
## 3. Challenges and Achievements
<br/>
### 3.1 Detail the specific challenges you encountered during the course, such as understanding new programming concepts, completing WODs, web application development assignments.
### 3.2 Explain how you overcame these challenges and the strategies that helped you succeed.
### 3.3 Highlight any particular achievements or milestones in the course that were significant to you.
<br/>
## 4. Skill Development and Application
<br/>
### 4.1 Reflect on the three skill levels outlined in the course (syntactic, algorithmic, application) and discuss your progression through these levels.
The beginning of the course was syntactic-focused, just getting us used to creating HTML pages, starting and stopping the server, and knowing how GET works. I think I progressed through this part quickly and it wasn't very difficult because I took ICS 101 and many of the HTML skills we had already learned in that course. The algorithmic section was pretty difficult because I had no prior experience using JavaScript, so all of it was new to me. These were like the functions, loops, if-statements, etc. We would learn and then put the different algorithmic code together to make a bigger statement. I would say the application skill level was worked on right before spring break and the rest of the class, starting with the Store WODs. This was both extremely difficult and fairly easy because some things we had prior experience with from labs, so it was just taking code we already knew and applying it in a different way. Other parts were really hard to think of how to write a natural language into the correct code that would work. I think after Assignment 1, I was doing well with the application skill because it gave me more confidence.
### 4.2 Describe how the hands-on experience with web-based e-service applications enhanced your understanding and confidence in handling MIS issues.

<br/>
## 5. Use of AI (e.g. ChatGPT)
<br/>
### 5.1 Discuss how use of AI enhanced your learning and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI effectively.
AI was an excellent tool for troubleshooting small issues that may have been syntax related. I often used AI when I would get errors in my console but didn't know what they meant. I was able to copy the error into ChatGPT, along with the corresponding code I was trying to run and it would tell me where the error was located or some things I could do to fix it. I also used ChatGPT to create the base for some of my if statements and functions. I could tell it what I wanted to accomplish with my function and the different loops, ifs, or variables that I wanted to use and it would generate a base for me. I then did not have to create the whole thing because I tweaked the base with my own information to do what I needed. 
### 5.2 Discuss how use of AI inhibited your learning or and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI ineffectively.
While AI was good at creating a base for my functions, it would sometimes give me things that I had not learned. Most of the time, I was able to recognize that we hadn't learned it and I told it to generate something new, but sometimes I would be so stuck that I accepted ChatGPT's suggestion and it would lead to bigger issues. This happened to me during Assignment 2 when I couldn't figure out how to move the quantities through the query string so I had asked ChatGPT and it made me use localStorage, which we had not learned. It ended up causing me more trouble when I wanted to move the quantities to the invoice, so I ultimately asked Prof. Port for help and erased all the GPT code for that. It made me stuck for 3 days when it could have been easily fixed had I asked Prof. Port earlier.
<br/>
## 6. Future Implications and Professional Growth
<br/>
### 6.1 Explore how the skills and knowledge gained from ITM 352 can be applied in your future academic and professional endeavors.
Learning how to troubleshoot on my own using the web browser console, AI, and other resources will be helpful in my academics considering that not all professors are always available or willing to help with issues. ITM 352 gave me a base understanding of JavaScript and coding that I can build upon to maybe create websites or other applications for businesses. It is also a good skill to be able to put basic JavaScript knowledge on my resume. 
### 6.2 Discuss the potential impacts these skills will have on your career, especially in terms of understanding and addressing MIS problems.
### 6.3 Reflect on the overall value of the course in your educational journey and future career.
I think this course has given me the confidence to continue with the MIS major and perhaps get a master's degree in it. I had been advised that this is one of, if not the hardest course in the MIS pathway, so I feel accomplished to have survived it. I was unsure at first, but I found the content and the web creation to be interesting and enjoyable, so I think it is something I would be happy doing for my career. I learned how to solve problems on my own and utilize my resources to the fullest.
