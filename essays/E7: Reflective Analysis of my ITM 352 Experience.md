## 1. Course Goals ITM 352 has the following goals:
### 1.1 Acquiring basic programming skills in an IT context
### 1.2 Understanding why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge
### 1.3 Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications
### 1.4 Experiencing first-hand MIS problems and solutions
### 1.5 Experiencing and understanding first-hand project management, working in teams, software development issues
### 1.6 Gaining confidence in addressing MIS problems
### 1.7 For each of the above goals, explain what stands out in your class experience that indicates you have met that goal. You do not need to be comprehensive but do be specific. You should make each goal a sub-section.

## 2. Course Elements and Personal Engagement
### 2.1 What did you learn from creating a professional portfolio and using it in ITM 352?
### 2.2 What did you gain from doing the WODs?
### 2.3 Were the quizzes helpful in preparing you for the labs?
### 2.4 What did you learn from doing the labs?
### 2.5 What did you learn from doing the essays?
### 2.6 What did you learn from doing Assignment 1 and Assignment 2?

## 3. Challenges and Achievements
### 3.1 Detail the specific challenges you encountered during the course, such as understanding new programming concepts, completing WODs, web application development assignments.
### 3.2 Explain how you overcame these challenges and the strategies that helped you succeed.
### 3.3 Highlight any particular achievements or milestones in the course that were significant to you.

## 4. Skill Development and Application
### 4.1 Reflect on the three skill levels outlined in the course (syntactic, algorithmic, application) and discuss your progression through these levels.
### 4.2 Describe how the hands-on experience with web-based e-service applications enhanced your understanding and confidence in handling MIS issues.


## 5. Use of AI (e.g. ChatGBT)
### 5.1 Discuss how use of AI enhanced your learning and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI effectively.
AI was an excellent tool for troubleshooting small issues that may have been syntax related. I often used AI when I would get errors in my console but didn't know what they meant. I was able to copy the error into ChatGPT, along with the corresponding code I was trying to run and it would tell me where the error was located or some things I could do to fix it. I also used ChatGPT to create the base for some of my if statements and functions. I could tell it what I wanted to accomplish with my function and the different loops, ifs, or variables that I wanted to use and it would generate a base for me. I then did not have to create the whole thing because I tweaked the base with my own information to do what I needed. 
### 5.2 Discuss how use of AI inhibited your learning or and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI ineffectively.
While AI was good at creating a base for my functions, it would sometimes give me things that I had not learned. Most of the time, I was able to recognize that we hadn't learned it and I told it to generate something new, but sometimes I would be so stuck that I accepted ChatGPT's suggestion and it would lead to bigger issues. This happened to me during Assignment 2 when I couldn't figure out how to move the quantities through the query string so I had asked ChatGPT and it made me use localStorage, which we had not learned. It ended up causing me more trouble when I wanted to move the quantities to the invoice, so I ultimately asked Prof. Port for help and erased all the GPT code for that. It made me stuck for 3 days when it could have been easily fixed had I asked Prof. Port earlier.

## 6. Future Implications and Professional Growth
### 6.1 Explore how the skills and knowledge gained from ITM 352 can be applied in your future academic and professional endeavors.
Learning how to troubleshoot on my own using the web browser console, AI, and other resources will be helpful in my academics considering that not all professors are always available or willing to help with issues. ITM 352 gave me a base understanding of JavaScript and coding that I can build upon to maybe create websites or other applications for businesses. It is also a good skill to be able to put basic JavaScript knowledge on my resume. 
### 6.2 Discuss the potential impacts these skills will have on your career, especially in terms of understanding and addressing MIS problems.
### 6.3 Reflect on the overall value of the course in your educational journey and future career.
I think this course has given me the confidence to continue with the MIS major and perhaps get a master's degree in it. I had been advised that this is one of, if not the hardest course in the MIS pathway, so I feel accomplished to have survived it. I was unsure at first, but I found the content and the web creation to be interesting and enjoyable, so I think it is something I would be happy doing for my career. I learned how to solve problems on my own and utilize my resources to the fullest.
