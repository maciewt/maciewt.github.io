##Invoice 1 WOD
During this WOD, we were supposed to create an invoice receipt for a customer who had purchased items from us. We included elements like the objects sold, prices, units, subtotals, and grand totals. Click [Invoice 1 repo link](https://github.com/maciewt/ITM352_S24_repo/tree/97f7ebc297941aeaf17abbbbb871c4ee7d1fd461/WODs/Invoice1)https://github.com/maciewt/ITM352_S24_repo/tree/97f7ebc297941aeaf17abbbbb871c4ee7d1fd461/WODs/Invoice1) to see my Invoice 1. I thought that this WOD was fairly easy. I understood how to create all the variables and use the operators, so I had no trouble with that. The only thing that slowed me down was inputting the variables into the table. I was unsure what method to use and the instructions confused me a bit. I used the same method of trying the code on my own first before consulting the screencast. The only thing I did differently was review the PowerPoint notes and some of the reading from W2 Schools. I think this helped refresh my knowledge and I was able to understand it better since we had gone over the skills during class. To be better prepared, maybe I could review the labs to see if any of the skills covered there could be used in the WOD. For the next WOD, I might do the entire thing even if the code doesn't work. Then, I can consult the screencast for what to fix instead of just seeing solutions with no work done.
