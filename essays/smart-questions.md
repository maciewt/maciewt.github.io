My name is Macie Tsang and I am currently a sophomore. I am double majoring in Marketing and Management Information Systems. Initially, I had no intention of obtaining an MIS degree, but after my ICS 101 class, I was very interested in HTML web design towards the end of the course. I then became involved in the department and considered pursuing an MIS or CS degree. After much contemplation, I did not want to do the calculus that would have been required in CS, so I am pursuing an MIS double major here in ITM 352 as my first step!
