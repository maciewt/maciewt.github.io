## Browser History 1
During this WOD, we were expected to make an index.html and copy the text from a given website into our HTML as paragraphs, as well as adding a linked "Table of Contents" and images. I had a brief idea of what to do in the beginning, so I forgot to time myself on my first attempt, but I would say it was around 30 minutes because I got stumped and had to watch the screencast solution to see how to link the Table of Contents. I learned that I forgot the "id=" and that I had to put a "#" to correspond to that id in the Table of Contents, I redid it and got 23 minutes because I forgot the table of contents link solution, so I didn't have to watch the whole video again, I just had to look at the code to remind myself what to do. My final attempt was 14 minutes and I was very happy with that. I would say trying to do it the first time but not putting pressure on myself to get it perfect was helpful. I think I found it easier because I was only using the screencast to fill gaps in my knowledge and not learn the whole thing from scratch.

## Browser History 2
This WOD focused more on CSS and being able to change the background, margins, image placement, font text and color. I thought this WOD was going to be easy because I was familiar with all of the skills. On my first attempt, I was so frustrated because I had finished everything in about 10 minutes, but my fonts would not change to Oswald or Open Sans even though I followed the solutions. I had to ask the Discord for help because I did not see any visible mistakes I had made on my end. After Dr. Port answered me, I attempted but finished at the DNF time again because the fonts still weren't working even with the link I was instructed to add. I ended up figuring out that when I inputted the fonts into my CSS, I put "'Oswald' san-serif;" and I forgot the comma between Oswald and san-serif. I was so irritated, but I'm sure to be more careful when I type and to check typing mistakes first. After that, my final attempt was around 5 minutes because I understood how to do everything and it was a breeze once the fonts worked.

## Browser History 3
This WOD used div classes and IDs to change formatting. My first attempt was 24 minutes because I did what I could with my knowledge of nav bars, but I watched the Screencast solution to double-check and help with the columns. Turns out I had used a different method for the navigation than the video, so I redid what I had done to match what we were learning. I was confused about the difference between div class and div ID, but realized they're essentially the same thing, they just use different symbols when it comes to the CSS. Once I got that down, it was fairly easy and I understood why we used components like float and padding. My second attempt was 8 minutes and I got everything, I just felt I could've been faster because I was stuttering and trying to remember the information, so I redid it and got a final time of 6 minutes and 34 seconds.
